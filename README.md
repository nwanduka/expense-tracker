# expense-tracker
A personal, open-source expense tracking system built to understand spending, track multiple accounts, and practice cloud-native engineering and observability.

## Problem

I often lose track of where my money goes each month. With multiple bank accounts, apps, and frequent transfers, it’s hard to know my total inflows, outflows, and spending patterns.

This project aims to solve that problem while giving me a sandbox to learn cloud-native tools, observability, and site reliability engineering.

## Goals

- Log income and expenses across accounts.
- Track spending trends and generate summaries.
- Build with observability-first principles (metrics, structured logs, traces).
- Learn and practice cloud-native technologies (Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, OpenTelemetry).
- Make it open-source so that others can use it for free.
